# 1337

The "1337" Bash script is a simple tool that allows you to convert text into leet (1337) code. Leet code is a form of online communication where letters are replaced with numbers or special characters that resemble the letters. This script provides a basic implementation of this conversion process.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Bash installed on your system.
2. Download or clone the script to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the script's directory.

### Syntax

```bash
./1337 <text>
```

Replace `<text>` with the text you want to convert to leet code.

### Example

```bash
./1337 "Hello, world!"
```

Output:
```
Leet (1337) code: H3110, w0r1d!
```

## Customization

You can customize the leet substitutions in the `leet_encrypt` function of the script to modify the characters and symbols used for conversion. Feel free to experiment with different substitutions to create your own leet code variations.
